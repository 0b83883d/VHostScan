The original class for this project was taken from [Reconnoitre](https://github.com/codingo/Reconnoitre) which was originally adapted from [teknogeek's virtual-host-scan](https://github.com/teknogeek/virtual-host-discovery-py). This in turn was very heavily influenced by jobertabma's virtual host discovery script ([link](https://github.com/jobertabma/virtual-host-discovery)).
